# Sentiment analysis

This is a project that was made to show how sentiment analysis can be done with and without NLTK Library.
- One file consists the analysis of a sentence to draw out the emotions of that sentence using NLTK.
- And the other file fulfills the same objective without using NLTK but by using a list of emotions and keywords associated with those emotions.

Hope you like it!
